# CCD Travel Expenses Console App

It is a Python Console app that automates logging, reporting & approval of CCDs' travel expenses using an api to a gspread sheet.  CCD is an SME which reimburses 4 employees for travel expenses when they use their private car for business purposes. This occurs on an irregular basis & does not go above the tax free threshold.

## Introduction

There are 4 staff at CCD who use their own private car for CCD related business travel to some 6 predefined locations.  CCD follow the Civil Service rates from www.revenue.ie. The rate per KM is dependant on the engine size of the employees' car. The rate is taken from Band 1 of the table as annual claims per employee are under 1000km.  The reimbursement can be made, tax free, by the amount of business kilometres travelled. Rates are outline in the table below.

<!-- Civil Service Mileage or Motoring Rates : -->

![Civil Service Motoring Rates](docs/revenue-milage-rates.PNG )

The app is just for 2023 so the year is not taken into account for this MVP.  The distance per location, rates per engine size & Reimbursement amount per location per car engine size are outlined in the table below, This table was helpful when testing the app for correct calculations of reimbursement amounts.

![Amounts](docs/ci-amounts.PNG)

It seems that although there is widespread conversion to metric the term 'mileage rate' is still widely used when actually meaning rate per kilometer. If you come across this term in this README or code comments then its meaning is actually rate per kilometer.

## DESIGN

Below is the initial work flow envisaged when starting work on this project.

![Inital Flowchart](docs/flowchart.PNG)

### SCOPE
For this implementation of the travel expenses I have planned the following features

* Allow user to enter travel expenses in as easy a way as possible & calculate amount to be reimbursed for each trip
* Display warning/error when user enters invalid input & hints as to what is valid
* Allow user to list the approved travel expenses and the list awaiting approval
* Allow manager to approve travel expenses in individual or group (Note as I will not be implementing user login, manager & user are not  distinguisable)

## Goal = UX/UX + user story

*  the app should be easy to get around
*  info that appears on terminal should be relevent to what user is doing at that time
*  instruction should help the user determine what information is to be entered
*  the trip worksheet should be updated with correct values
*  the reports should list the correct records

### User stories 

As a user I want to...

* be able to submit a travel expenses record easily
* I want to know reimbursement amount
* add several records in a row
* run report to see what I entered
* run report to see whats already on database
* see how many are awaiting approval

## Features

### Main Menu

Main menu has 4 options as follows

![Main Menu](docs/mainmenu.PNG)

The only acceptable user input at this stage is a number between 1 and 4 whitespace is stripped with `replace(" ", "")`,  Any other input is not accepted and user is advised accordingly, for instance blank input, non numeric input, numerics out of range... 

![Main Menu Wrong Input](docs/mainmenu-wrong-input.PNG)

The user at this stage can pick one of 3 choice to do something or #4 to exit the program.  The 3 options are
    1. To Log travel expense(s)
    2. To generate travel expense report(s)
    3. To approve travel expense(s)

Chosing #1 will bring the user to the following screen

![Main Menu Option 1](docs/mainmenu-option1.PNG)


### Log Travel Expense(s) (Trip)

The 1st time user is presented with a screenful of information to assist in submitting travel expenses, There are restrictions such as only 4 employees can submit an expense and there are 6 locations approved, These details are held in the gsheet and displayed to the user in the first couple of lines. In order to make it easier for the user to enter a trip the app converts all inputdata comparasions to lowercase so it is case insensitive,  the user is advised of this and can use preferred case.  The user is also advised that if they can give just 3 letters of either the first name or surname of the employee, the app will be able to expand those 3 letters to the full employee name.  It does the same with destination & due to similarities i was able to condense this to one function called `expand_data()`.  The user is informed about how the reimbursement amount is calculated and that there is a unique identifier (NUM-ID) for each travel expense.  Below are some examples of  entering valid travel expense records

#### Error Handling for Logging a trip
There are 3 items input to log a trip - Who goes on the trip, Where do they go & the when. Each item has its own restrictions, such as who needs to be one of the 4 authorised employees, Destination needs to be one of 6 locations and the date - entered in dd/mm format -  needs to be a valid date month combination.  Here are examples of incorrect Employee, incorrect destination  & incorrect date :

![Invalid Trip](docs/invalid-trips.PNG)

A `ValueError` is raised if user inputs less than 3 letters for either the employee or destination, or if there is less than 3 items input or if the user just pressed return, see examples below

![Invalid Trip2](docs/invalid-trips2.PNG)

#### Seek users approval before submitting record 

Once the users input is accepted the app will construct a 'travel expense record' and seek the users approval before it is entered into the database.  This also give the user reimbursement amount for the first time. User has the option to say no to submitting to database.

![tara record](docs/tara-to-brown.PNG)

#### Enter Another Record

User can repeat entering travel expense records and when finished will be returned to main menu.  Again the y/n responses are not case sensitive.

## Future Goals

Import colorama to give red color to error text, yellow color to informtion text etc
Expand the "Log" section to allow user to enter travel expenses for employees and locations not pre defined.
Expand the reports section to list travel expenses by month, destination & employee, giving subtotals etc where appropriate.
Expand the reports section to summarise travel expenses ie total monthly reimbursement etc
Implement a user login with an audit trail
Implement manager login that is only user allowed to approve expenses    



## Data Model

A google sheet is used to store the trips. The sheet consists of 3 worksheets, "Employee", "Distance" & "Trip".  Employee and Distance are static worksheets that give python information needed to calculate the reimbursment amount per trip. Trip is dynamic worksheet updated via the console in 2 separate processes.  First trip details entered via console which adds a new travel expense record to the worksheet, There is a unique ID assigned to each record & held in the last/G column of the worksheet, This ID is automatically added by the spreadsheet. The 2nd type of update is when travel expense/expenses are approved by an manager and they go from ahvving a "Pending" status to "Approved" status in the first/A column.

datasheets prepopulated .. status data...authorised employees authorised destinations
#### NOTES
did not use pandas as very simple and small spreadsheet only with 5/6 columns, travel expenses will of coarse grow 
Did want to have user inpit on same line as request and foiund i could use end="" as 2nd argument to print function BUT then thought that i ahve to put a /n on all print and input statments for some "quirk" on terminal so can't do this
###
OOP - need to mention that not used OOP as simple worksheet
Did use CRUD & Custom error handling

### manual testing - test each feature, each user story each purpose
### Exception Handling
on input

## Testing What to test 
#### manual
 test each feature, each user story each purpose
#### code validaiton incl screenshots pep8online with no errors or warnings
#### error handling tests
user submit empty innput
ensure error message are informative

ie
I ahve implemented the validate_data method that is called at every step of the ordering process for validaitn input fo the suer, mentod can be adapted to number of menu items by changing vakue of its parameters
the vlaue parameter gets the 
this heature was tested by simulating the error

blank input
non numeric input
..show screenshots
#### test user stories
table with user stories one column and testing on other column which in Tipsslideshow is just how to do what the user wants rather than how to test (and maybe outcome)

### test features

table with these headings
feature action effect

Real time information from the google spreadsheet
tested by comparing the output from the terminal for X report with the content that exists at that time in the corresponding worksheet
 & if there is changes to the worksheet that the ouytput to terminal is changed

 so will need to confirm calculations are correct
 confirm that ssheet is updated correctly
 this si part of FEATURE testing




## Bugs record all bugs, state what was the problem & if solution include screenshots


TypeError: Object of type datetime is not JSON serializable

Future Features :

if the client liked the app then i would suggest having more meangingful menu pick options  rather than numeric 1,2,3 ie A for Approve, P for Pending L for log a trip
but this is just MVP to give client idea of what can be done

### Validator Testing
PEP8 - no errors returned from pep8online.com

## Deployment
The project was deployed using Code Institute mock terminal for Heroku

Steps
fork or clone this repo
creat a new Heroku app
set the buildbacks to Python and NodeJS in that order
Link rhe Heroku app to the repo
click on deploy

This application uses Heroku for deployment

Create the application
First create the requirements file the Heroku will use to import the dependencies required for deployment: type pip3 freeze > requirements.txt. For this project the requirements.txt file is empty as no libraries or modules were imported other than from the standard python library.
Navigate to the Heroku website
create an account by entering your email address and a password
Activate the account through the authentication email sent to your email account
Click the new button and select create a new app from the dropdown menu
Enter a name for the application which must be unique, in this case the app name is after-the-party
Select a region, in this case Europe
Click create app
Heroku settings
From the horizontal menu bar select 'Settings'.
In the buildpacks section, where further necessary dependencies are installed, click 'add buildpack'. Select 'Python' first and click 'save changes'. Next click 'node.js' and then click 'save changes' again. The 'Python' buildpack must be above the 'node.js' buildpack'. They can be clicked on and dragged to change the order if necessary.
Deployment
In the top menu bar select 'Deploy'.
In the 'Deployment method' section select 'Github' and click the connect to Github button to confirm.
In the 'search' box enter the Github repository name for the project. Click search and then click connect to link the heroku app with the Github repository. The box will confirm that heroku is connected to the repository which in this case is After the Party.
Scroll down to select either automatic or manual deployment. For this project automatic deployment was selected. If you wish to choose automatic deployment select the button 'Enable Automatic Deploys'. This will rebuild the app every time a change is pushed to Github. If you wish to manually deploy click the button 'Deploy Branch'. The default 'Master' option in the dropdown menu should be selected in both cases.
When the app is deployed a message 'Your app was successfully deployed' will be shown. Click 'view' to see the deployed app in the browser. The live deployment of the project can be seen here
The app starts automatically and can be restarted by pressing the 'Run Program' button.
Forking the Repository
If you wish to fork the repository to make changes without affecting the original you can fork the repository

Navigate to the After the Party repository
Click the 'Fork' button at the top right of the page.
A forked copy of the repository will appear in your Repositories page.
Cloning the Repository
On Github navigate to the main page of the After the Party.
Above the list of files click the dropdown code menu.
Select the https option and copy the link.
Open the terminal.
Change the current working directory to the desired destination location.
Type the git clone command with the copied URL: git clone https://github.com/siob
Press enter to create the local clone.

## Reminders

* Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
* Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
* Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.
pip3 install gspread google-auth dependencies that had to be installed
## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

Happy coding!
